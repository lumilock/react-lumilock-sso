# react-lumilock-sso
## üìö Getting started
This package allows you to create protected routes using a centralized authentication, a "Single Sign-On - Auth0". For this we use a cookie system, using the [react-cookie]('https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie') library, your applications must therefore be on the same domain.

Before install react-lumilock-sso you need to install some peerDependancies.  
This is the liste of peer dependances :
- react
- prop-types
- styled-components
- react-router-dom
- redux
- react-redux
- redux-thunk  

You can install them all with the following command :
```
npm install react prop-types styled-components react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk
```

After that you can install react-lumilock-sso
```
npm install react-lumilock-sso
```
## ````<LumilockProvider />````
Provider that manages authentication on all routes.

## ````<ProtectedRoutes />````
Accessible Route only by authenticated users
```jsx
<ProtectedRoutes path="/home" external="http://localhost:3000/login" exact component={Home} />
```
```jsx
<ProtectedRoutes path="/home" redirect="/login" exact component={Home} />
```
### props
This component takes the same props as the `Route` component of `react-router-dom` except that he accepts two more props `redirect` and `external`.
#### `redirect`
Use the `Redirect`component of `react-router-dom` to redirect an unauthenticated user to a location of your choice inside your app.
#### `external`
Redirect an unauthenticated user to a location of your choice outside of your app if your login page is centralized for multiple apps.

## ````<GuestRoutes />````
Accessible Route only by unauthenticated users.
```jsx
<GuestRoutes path="/login"exact external="http://localhost:1234/home" component={Login} />
```
```jsx
<GuestRoutes path="/login"exact redirect="/home" component={Login} />
```
### props
This component takes the same props as the `Route` component of `react-router-dom` except that he accepts two more props `redirect` and `external`.
#### `redirect`
Use the `Redirect`component of `react-router-dom` to redirect an authenticated user to a location of your choice inside your app.
#### `external`
Redirect an authenticated user to a location of your choice outside of your app if your login page is centralized for multiple apps.
## ````<LoginForm />````
Component to create the login form which allows users to connect to your api.


## ````authReducer()````
The redux reducer to create the store, you need to add it in all apps.
```js
import { authReducer } from 'react-lumilock-sso'
...
const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    ...
    auth: authReducer
  }),
  ...
)
```
## Environment variable
```.env
REACT_APP_AUTH_API_URL = 'http://your/login/api/'
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN = 'localhost' // (string): domain for the cookie (sub.domain.com or .allsubdomains.com)
```

## üöÄ Simple Example 
In this example we do not detail the creation of a react application, or the integration of dotenv, redux and react-router-dom packages.  
We present the integration of react-lumilock-sso in two applications which are on the same domain.
So we have a `create-react-app` on `http://localhost:3000/`, a `parcel` app on `http://localhost:1234/` and an `lumilock` API on `http://localhost:8000/`.  
  
On the two front-end app we install the `react-lumilock-sso` package.
```shell
npm install react-lumilock-sso
```
### Parcel app
First we add environnement variable in `.env`

#### `file : .env` 
```.env
REACT_APP_AUTH_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api/auth/'
```
Then we configure the  `redux` store

#### `file : ./store/index.js` 
```jsx
...
import { authReducer } from 'react-lumilock-sso'
...
const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    ...
    auth: authReducer
  }),
  ...
)
```
Now we can add the protected route to our app, for this exemple we made all the route inside the root of the project.  
#### `file : ./index.js`
```jsx
...
import { LumilockProvider, ProtectedRoutes } from "react-lumilock-sso";
...
function App() {
  ...
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <LumilockProvider>
        <Router>
         ...
          <Switch>
            ...
            <ProtectedRoutes path="/dashboard" external="http://localhost:3000/login" exact component={Dashboard} />
            <ProtectedRoutes path="/profile" external="http://localhost:3000/login" exact component={Profile} />
            ...
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </LumilockProvider>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```
### Create-react-app
First we add environnement variable in `.env`

#### `file : .env` 
```.env
REACT_APP_AUTH_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api/auth/'
```
Then we configure the  `redux` store

#### `file : ./src/store/index.js` 
```jsx
...
import { authReducer } from 'react-lumilock-sso'
...
const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    ...
    auth: authReducer
  }),
  ...
)
```
Now we can add the protected route to our app, for this exemple we made all the route inside the root of the project.  
#### `file : ./src/App.js`
```jsx
...
import { LumilockProvider, ProtectedRoutes, GuestRoutes } from "react-lumilock-sso";
...
function App() {
  ...
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <LumilockProvider>
        <Router>
         ...
          <Switch>
            ...
            <GuestRoutes path="/login" exact component={Login} />
            <ProtectedRoutes path="/dashboard" redirect="/login" exact component={Dashboard} />
            <ProtectedRoutes path="/profile" redirect="/login" exact component={Profile} />
            ...
          </Switch>
        </Router>
      </LumilockProvider>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```
#### Conclusion
We saw how to set up an sso system between two React projects, putting the login page on only one of the two projects. Obviously it is possible to put connection pages on each of your projects, in order to avoid reloading your applications during redirects
